We will finish up  this section with a few pointers to other useful tools  to help monitor your workloads on Kubernetes. First, it is very useful to see how your user's are actually experiencing the website. 

1.  Navigate to Real User Monitoring at this URL: https://app.datadoghq.com/rum. 
2.  Click the button to create a **New Application**.
3.  For **Application type**, choose JS.
4.  Enter **frontend** for the **Application Name**.
5.  Click the **Create New RUM Application** buttton. 
6.  Take note of the **applicationId** and **clientToken** strings.
7.  Open **frontend.yaml** in the **environment/section4** directory. Uncomment the lines for the environment variables **DD_CLIENT_TOKEN** and **DD_APPLICATION_ID**.
8.  Paste in the corresponding strings into the values in the file.
9.  Apply the yaml file, then open the URL for the application. Remember, thatâ€™s the URL generated by ELB.
10. Switch back to the RUM UI. Within a few seconds you should see the page verify the installation. ![reporting successfully](/images/dd-reporting-successfully.png)

Real User Monitoring is great to see how your users are actually experiencing the website. Try visiting the application site and navigating around to a few different pages. Run a search. Then update the session in RUM to see the updated flow.
