The examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. 
These will help you understand how various cloud services can be used to build a solution while demonstrating best 
practices along the way. These examples are not intended for use in production environments. In the prerequisites section you setup a Datadog account separately from you production account. We are expecting you to use that account and not use your production accounts.
